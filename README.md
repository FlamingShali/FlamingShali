                                                    👋 Hi, I'm Michael (Michał in my native language :D)
 👀 I’m interested in working as a full stack developer. Currently I'm looking for my first job as a front-end/full-stack developer (trainee/junior level).
 🌱 I’m currently learning React Library with as many as I can handle 3rd party libraries and TS. I also plan to learn Python, SQL, and some C# with .NET 8.0. In short words I love to learn new stuff <3.
 
💞️ I'm working on some cool projects, like App for booking visits in hotel. I'm also creating my profile-page as SPA with using React library and styled-components for good UX.
Other projects i plan:
Car Shop as SPA (React library with supabase backend, Tailwind, ReactQuery, ReactHookForm, React-Router-Dom and more!)

📫 If you want contact me, just write me an email (I check every day few times :D)
